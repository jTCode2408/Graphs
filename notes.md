Graphs
=======

Nodes == Verts == Vertices == Vertexes
   -Thing that stores data

Edges - connect nodes
    -Can be unidirectional, or bidirectional
    

If a graph has directional edges = 'directed graph'

Traversals
==========

Keep track of what nodes have been visisted:
    *Visited flag
    *Hashtable
    *Set


Done traversing when stack is empty:
Push starting note to top of stack
while stack is not empty: do traversal
pop value off stack, mark visited, push neighbors to stack, repeat until stack is empty
