  graph of relationships between parents and children over multiple generations. The data is formatted as a list of (parent, child) pairs, where each individual is assigned a unique integer identifier.
  ============================
  * The input will not be empty.
* There are no cycles in the input.
* There are no "repeated" ancestors â€“ if two individuals are connected, it is by exactly one path.
* IDs will always be positive integers.
* A parent may have any number of children.
============================================
Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual
